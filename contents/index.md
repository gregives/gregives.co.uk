I'm a **final-year Computer Science student** at the University of Sheffield, looking for an opportunity in software engineering from June 2020. This summer I interned at [FinancialForce](https://financialforce.com). I'm a lead instructor at [Code First: Girls](https://codefirstgirls.org.uk) and a teaching assistant at the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs).
