I'm the lead software engineer at [Myles Wellbeing](https://www.myleswellbeing.com/), working remotely from [Nottingham](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nottingham). Recently, I've been building some AI&nbsp;tools, including a [poem generator](https://poetry.tips) and a [domain name generator](https://recommend.domains). I love making things that work well, look good and are easy-to-use for everyone.
