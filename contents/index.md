I'm a lead software engineer at [Myles Fitness Challenges](https://www.myleschallenges.com/), currently living in [Nottingham](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nottingham). I previously worked at [Capital One](https://capitalone.co.uk/), building websites and developer tools. I love making things that work well, look good and are easy-to-use for everyone.
