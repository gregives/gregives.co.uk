I'm a [Nottingham](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nottingham)-based freelance developer, currently building [Myles Fitness Challenges](https://www.myleschallenges.com/). I previously worked at [Capital One](https://capitalone.co.uk/), building websites and developer tools. I love making things that work well, look good and are easy-to-use for everyone.
