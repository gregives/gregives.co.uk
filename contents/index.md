I'm a Software Engineer and recent graduate of the University of Sheffield, currently working on web stuff at [Capital One](https://capitalone.co.uk/). I enjoy building projects like [Twelvety](https://github.com/gregives/Twelvety), discussing web performance and fonts, teaching others to code and organising events like hackathons.
