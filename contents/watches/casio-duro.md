If you ask any watch nerd what the best affordable diver's watch is, they'll probably say the Casio "Marlin" Duro. It has achieved worldwide fame and is loved by everyone, including [Bill Gates](https://twobrokewatchsnobs.com/watches-in-the-wild-bill-gates-wearing-a-casio-duro-marlin-mdv106-1a-on-the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert/). According to Casio, they've sold 600,000 of them worldwide.

When I was looking for my first affordable diver's watch, the Casio Duro immediately stood out to me: with a uni-directional rotating bezel, a screw-down crown and 200 m water resistance, you get a lot of watch for your money.

Let's take a look at the case of the Casio Duro first and how it fits on my small 6-inch wrist. The diameter of the case is 44 mm and it does wear like a 44 mm, with a lug-to-lug of 49 mm. This is really pushing the limits of my wrist, which only measures 52 mm across, however, the curved lugs do help the watch to sit flush on my wrist.

The height of the case is 12 mm, which felt very bulky coming from a Casio W-86! In hindsight, the case is very well proportioned and weighs in at a comfortable but noticable 92 g.

Like most diver's watches, the rubber strap is on the longer side to allow the watch can be worn over a wetsuit. There are plenty of holes in the strap to accomodate for all wrist sizes, although I found that the strap wrapped around my wrist too far, extending past the lugs on the other side of my wrist.

I replaced the rubber strap with a [solid link bracelet from AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000606250694.html), which is specifically ~~made~~ marketed for the Casio Duro. There are other solid link bracelets available for cheaper but the finishing on this bracelet matches almost perfectly with the finishing on the case, which we'll take a look at later. The bracelet has three micro-adjustment holes and a triple-lock clasp; the end links aren't solid and the clasp is stamped instead of milled but I think it is worth it for the price.

Turning the watch over reveals a screw-down case back engraved with the "Marlin" logo, which is a nice touch: the marlin is used by Casio to indicate 200 m of water resistance. Other than that, the case back is very plain.

Now let's take a look at the dial of the Casio Duro.

![Macro photo of the whole dial](/assets/images/dynamic/casio-duro/casio-duro-07.jpg)

The Casio Duro has a black "sunray" or "sunburst" dial which reflects the light in faint lines from the center of the watch. The effect is subtle but effective. Around the edge of the dial is a raised chapter ring with the minute track painted in white. The markers are slightly heavier at the 5-minute intervals.

On the dial itself sits the applied hour markers, which are very well aligned with the minute track, the Casio logo printed at the 12 o'clock position and the marlin logo at the 6 o'clock position. Immediately beneath the marlin is printed "WR 200M" in an uppercase serif font. The printed marlin looks a bit fuzzy when viewed up close but nothing to complain about given the astounding price of this watch.

The inverted white date window sits at the 3 o'clock position, contained within a white border. The edge of the date window is bevelled. In my opinion, the date window looks slightly too small compared to the size of the watch and it is hard to read at a glance.

The hands of the watch match the applied markers very well. The hour hand is an arrow-style hand and the minute hand is a pencil-style hand, both filled with lume. The second hand is bright red with a small lume-filled triangle towards the tip: this is my favourite part of the watch, I think it looks great!

The 120-click bezel on the Casio Duro is mediocre. The aluminium bezel insert looks good but there is too much play in the bezel for my liking and it doesn't _quite_ align with the chapter ring. It is uni-directional though, which is nice to see at this price point.

The lume on this watch is also okay but nothing to shout about. The photo above shows the lume after 2 minutes under bright light, however, 5 minutes later the lume was barely visible.

**The Casio Duro is one of the best watches you can buy for under £50**. If you're looking for an affordable diver's watch with a uni-directional rotating bezel, a screw-down crown and 200 m water resistance, this is the watch for you. If you're just looking for a watch that _looks_ like a diver's watch, you might want to opt instead for a diver's "style" watch like the [Pulsar PX3033X1](http://www.pulsarwatches-europe.com/Watch/PX3033X1) which trades features like the rotating bezel for a solar powered movement.
