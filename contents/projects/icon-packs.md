I made my first Android app aged 14 --- I brought my coding and design skills together to create icon packs for custom launchers, such as Nova Launcher. My first icon pack, Trace, was designed as a transparent outlined-icon pack to allow minimal distraction from your homescreen wallpaper.

> Enhance the style of your homescreen with minimal interference from icons --- **Trace** icons are subtle and elegant, whilst allowing your wallpaper to show through.

Trace contains more than 1,000 icons, all created using Photoshop Touch on a Samsung Note tablet with a stylus! [Check out Trace on Google Play Store.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=grives.trace.iconpack)

After creating Trace, I started creating another icon pack named Squircle. As you might have guessed, the icon pack was centred around its shape --- somewhere between a circle and a square. The squircle shape has now become a very popular base for icons, for example, the default stock icons on Samsung phones.

> Introducing **Squircle**, a simplistic yet beautiful icon pack consisting of the characteristic squircle-shaped coloured outline, flat colours, and a subtle drop shadow. **Bring your home screen to life!**

I decided to offer Squircle as a free app, with a paid 'donation' app available for those who wanted to support the development. Squircle has now been downloaded more than 300,000 times and has more than 5,000 ratings.
