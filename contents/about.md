Hi there, I'm Greg Ives! I'm a developer, currently working on web stuff at [Capital One](https://capitalone.co.uk/). I love making things which work well, look good and are easy-to-use for everyone.

I recently graduated from the University of Sheffield with a master's degree in Computer Science. I became involved in [HackSheffield](https://hacksheffield.co), organising the hackathon for three years and attending hackathons across Europe. Whilst at university, I interned at [FinancialForce](https://www.financialforce.com/) and volunteered as a Lead Instructor for [Code First: Girls](https://codefirstgirls.org.uk/).

Here are some of the technologies I work with:

- React with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) or [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Vue with [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) and SCSS
- [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev/) with some HTML, CSS and a sprinkle of JavaScript

When I'm not staring at my computer, I like to get outside for a walk, run or bike ride. I also enjoy playing the trumpet!
