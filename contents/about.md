Hi there, I'm Greg Ives! I'm a freelance developer, currently working on developer tools at [Capital One](https://capitalone.co.uk/). I love making things which work well, look good and are easy-to-use for everyone.

I recently graduated from the University of Sheffield with a master's degree in Computer Science. I became involved in [HackSheffield](https://hacksheffield.co), organising the hackathon for three years and attending hackathons across Europe. Whilst at university, I interned at [FinancialForce](https://www.financialforce.com/) and volunteered as a Lead Instructor for [Code First: Girls](https://codefirstgirls.org.uk/).

Some of the technologies I've worked with recently are:

- React, Vue and Eleventy
- Styled Components, Tailwind, SCSS
- Flutter
- AWS and Jenkins

When I'm not staring at my computer, I like to get outside for a walk or bike ride. I also enjoy playing the cornet in [Hucknall and Linby Brass Band](https://www.hucknallandlinbybrass.co.uk/).
