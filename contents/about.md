Hi there, I'm Greg Ives! I'm a freelance developer, based in [Nottingham](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nottingham). I'm currently building [Myles Wellbeing](https://www.myleswellbeing.com/), an app that allows challengers to run, walk or cycle a wide range of virtual routes from around the world.

I graduated from the University of Sheffield in 2020 with a master's degree in Computer Science, after which I worked at [Capital One](https://capitalone.co.uk/) as a software engineer. During my time at Capital One, I worked in a web development team and a developer tools team, managing services on Jenkins and Amazon Web Services.

Things I'm excited about at the moment:

- Building performant and accessible websites
- Cross-platform design systems
- Great developer experience _without sacrificing user experience_
- Hackathons that are inclusive and don't burn you out

When I'm not staring at my computer, I like to get outside for a walk or bike ride. I also enjoy playing the cornet in [Hucknall and Linby Brass Band](https://www.hucknallandlinbybrass.co.uk/).
