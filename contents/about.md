Hi there, I'm Greg Ives! I'm in my final year at the University of Sheffield, studying a masters in Computer Science. I love making things which work well, look good and are easy-to-use for everyone.

I have a lot of experience building performant and accessible websites. Recently, I have been taking a look at JAMstack --- this website is statically generated using Nuxt. I am an avid hackathoner, attending hackathons across Europe and organising [HackSheffield](https://hacksheffield.co) for the past three years. I am a strong believer that you can learn just as much in your spare time as in education, most of my knowledge has come from hackathons and my side projects.

Last summer I worked as an intern at [FinancialForce](https://financialforce.com), working on the #1 Professional Services Automation app on the Salesforce platform. I volunteer as Lead Instructor for [Code First: Girls](https://codefirstgirls.org.uk), teaching young women and non-binary people to build their first website. I am also a teaching assistant at the University of Sheffield, having taught the first-year _Devices & Networks_, _Java Programming_ and _An Introduction to Software Engineering_ modules in Computer Science labs.

I'm very excited to be joining [Capital One](https://capitalone.co.uk/) next year as a Software Development Engineer!
