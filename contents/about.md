Hi there, I'm Greg Ives! I'm a software engineer based in [Nottingham](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nottingham). I'm currently building [Myles Wellbeing](https://www.myleswellbeing.com/), an app that rewards employees for living a healthy lifestyle.

I graduated from the University of Sheffield in 2020 with a master's degree in Computer Science, after which I worked at [Capital One](https://capitalone.co.uk/) as a software engineer. During my time at Capital One, I worked in a web development team and a developer tools team, managing services on Jenkins and Amazon Web Services.

Things I'm excited about at the moment:

- Building performant and accessible websites
- Cross-platform design systems
- Great developer experience _without sacrificing user experience_

When I'm not staring at my computer, I like to get outside for a run or a bike ride. I also enjoy playing the cornet in [Hucknall and Linby Brass Band](https://www.hucknallandlinbybrass.co.uk/) and drinking too much coffee.
