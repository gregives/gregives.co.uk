Picnic Spots was created at HackBordeaux with another member of HackSheffield, in 24 hours. Picnic Spots allows you to find a perfect spot for your lunch, courtesy of user-submitted spots and reviews.

I created Picnic Spots with another team member from HackSheffield, Arnas Boruchovas. At first we were struggling to come up with an idea, so we took some time outside to have a break. Whilst searching for a place to eat our lunch, we had an idea--a website to find nice picnic spots!

Picnic Spots was created using:

- Express for routing and middleware
- EJS for templating
- Sass for styling
- Passport for authentication
- Mapbox for the interactive map
