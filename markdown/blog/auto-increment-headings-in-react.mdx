    "A really simple ‘trick’ to automatically number headings in React.",
};

I've recently launched [Jotboard](https://jotboard.co), a Google Jamboard alternative, which allows you to import your boards from Jamboard. One of the pages contains headings like this:

- Step 1
- Step 2
- Step 3

## The Challenge

How can we create these headings in React? We could hard-code the headings like so:

```jsx
export default function ImportPage() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h2>Step 1</h2>
      <h2>Step 2</h2>
      <h2>Step 3</h2>
    </main>
  );
}
```

But what if we want to add another step in-between Step 1 and Step 2? This would be even worse if we had 50 steps.

## The Inspiration

I like how Markdown handles numbered lists: you can just use `1.` for every item and it will automatically number the list for you.

```md
1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
```

Will render:

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3

## The Trick

So how can we do this in React? After some thinking, I realised that you can automatically increment headings in React by using the increment `++` operator. Which seems obvious in hindsight!

```jsx
export default function ImportPage() {
  let step = 1;

  return (
    <main>
      <h2>Step {step++}</h2>
      <h2>Step {step++}</h2>
      <h2>Step {step++}</h2>
    </main>
  );
}
```

The `++` operator will return the value of the variable and then increment the variable, which is exactly what we want.
